This is my first website assignment to create a recipe website using my HTML, CSS, Javascript skills.

I will be using Linux-Xubuntu, Oracle VM VirtualBox, Visual Studio Code, xfce4-terminal, Bash shell, Git and Github in this project.

Edit (Nov 11th,2024): Along the way, I learned and used CSS Flexbox extensively which was a very useful tool.
